                <a href="#question1">1.Is it mandatory to take the vaccine?</a>
                <div class="answer">
                    Vaccination for COVID-19 is voluntary. However, it is advisable to receive the complete schedule of COVID-19 vaccine for protecting oneself against this disease and also to limit the spread of this disease to the close contacts including family members,
                    friends, relatives and co-workers.

                <a href="#question2">2.Do I need to use the mask/other COVID-19 appropriate precautions after receiving
                    the vaccine?</a>
                <div class="answer">
                    Yes, it is absolutely necessary that everyone who has received the COVID-19 vaccine should continue to follow the COVID-19 appropriate behaviour i.e., mask, do gaj ki doori and hand sanitization to protect themselves and those around from spreading the
                    infection.

                <a href="#question3">3.Which vaccine is better between Covisheild and Covaxin?</a>
                <div class="answer">
                    There is no head-to-head comparison done between the two vaccines being used in India so one cannot choose one over the other. Both would work fine in preventing the infection as well as prevent a person from going into severe state of the disease. As
                    a long-term effect, it would be preventing death for elderly people or those who have comorbidities.

                <a href="#question4">4.When is third wave of COVID-19 expected in India?</a>
                <div class="answer">
                    While cases are now much lower in India, the third wave is expected to arrive around October 2021. The current study extracts available data from the first two waves in various countries to prepare for the future surge in cases in India. The aim was to
                    promote preparedness and thus avert the worst outcomes.

                <div class="answer">
                    Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.
