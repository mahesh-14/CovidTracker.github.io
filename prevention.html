                <h3>Avoid crowded places</h3>
                <p>The risks of getting COVID-19 are higher in crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces where infected people spend long periods of time together in close proximity.These environments are where the virus appears to spread by respiratory
                    droplets or aerosols more efficiently, so taking precautions is even more important.</p>

                <h3>maintain distance</h3>
                <p>If you have to be around people, maintain a distance of 2 meters or 6 feet from others around you as much as possible.Not just mass gatherings, but even shopping malls, stadiums, and movie theatres can make you a target. In general, any
                    gathering of over ten people should be avoided or conducted virtually.</p>

                <h3>do not shake hands</h3>
                <p>If you are worried about COVID, the best way to make handshakes safe is to be fully vaccinated. And for any other things that might be on people’s hands, just wash your hands before you touch your face.While the coronavirus has reversed
                    physical greetings like the handshake, scientists believe it’s unlikely people would leave behind the tradition that dates back thousands of years.

                <h3>wash your hand</h3>
                <p>Follow these five steps every time.<br> <strong>1.wet</strong> your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap.<br> <strong>2.Lather</strong> your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Lather
                    the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.<br> <strong>3.Scrub</strong> your hands for at least 20 seconds.<br> <strong>4.Rinse</strong> your hands well under clean, running water.
                    <br> <strong>5.Dry</strong> your hands using a clean towel or air dry them.

                <h3>use sanitizer</h3>
                <p>Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains <strong>at least 60% alcohol.</strong>Supervise young children when they use hand sanitizer to prevent swallowing alcohol, especially in schools and childcare facilities. Put enough sanitizer
                    on your hands to cover all surfaces. Rub your hands together until they feel dry (this should take around 20 seconds).<br> <strong>DO NOT </strong>rinse or wipe off the hand sanitizer before it’s dry; it may not work well against germs.</p>

                <h3>wear a mask</h3>
                <p>Clean your hands before you put your mask on, as well as before and after you take it off, and after you touch it at any time.<br> Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin.<br> When you take off a mask, store it in a clean plastic
                    bag, and every day either wash it if it’s a fabric mask, or dispose of a medical mask in a trash bin.<br> <strong>Don’t</strong> use masks with valves.</p>
